# Code Review

## Files Reviewed:

### `index.ts`

**Summary of Changes:**
The prompt string passed to `codeReviewAgent` has been updated to reflect the new instructions for generating a commit message and writing the review to markdown.

**Feedback:**
*   **Clarity & Correctness:** The update to the prompt accurately reflects the expanded capabilities and instructions for the agent. This change ensures the agent is correctly guided to perform the new tasks.
*   **Maintainability (Minor Suggestion):** For future scalability, if the prompts become significantly longer or more dynamic, consider externalizing them into a separate configuration or prompt definition file. For the current scope, an inline string is acceptable.

### `prompts.ts`

**Summary of Changes:**
Backticks (`` ` ``) used around tool names (e.g., `generateCommitMessageTool`, `writeReviewToMarkdownTool`) have been escaped with a backslash (`` \` ``).

**Feedback:**
*   **Correctness & Readability (Excellent Improvement):** This is a very good and important correction! By escaping the backticks, you ensure that when this prompt is rendered (presumably as Markdown), the tool names will be displayed literally within code formatting (e.g., `generateCommitMessageTool`) rather than being interpreted as the start or end of a code block. This significantly improves the clarity and correct rendering of the instructions for the agent. Well done catching this detail.
