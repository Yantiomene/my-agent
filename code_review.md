### `index.ts`

**Changes:**
- The `codeReviewAgent` call has been updated to accept a prompt from the command-line arguments (`process.argv[2]`).
- A new variable `cliPrompt` is introduced to capture the command-line argument.
- `finalPrompt` is assigned the value of `cliPrompt`.
- An `if` condition checks if `finalPrompt` exists, then calls `codeReviewAgent` with it.
- An `else` block throws an error if no prompt is provided.

**Review:**

1.  **Flexibility and Reusability:**
    *   **Good:** This is a significant improvement! Hardcoding the prompt made the agent less versatile. By allowing the prompt to be passed via CLI arguments, the agent becomes much more flexible and reusable for different review scenarios.

2.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **Good:** The addition of an `else` block to `throw new Error('Error: You must provide a prompt')` is excellent. It provides clear feedback to the user if they forget to supply a necessary argument, improving the overall user experience and robustness of the script.

3.  **Clarity:**
    *   **Good:** The variable names `cliPrompt` and `finalPrompt` are clear and easy to understand. The logic for checking and using the prompt is straightforward.

4.  **Nit: Newline at End of File:**
    *   **Suggestion:** The file is missing a newline character at the end (`No newline at end of file`). While not strictly a functional bug, this is a common best practice in many codebases and can prevent issues with `diff` tools or linters. Consider adding a blank line at the end of the file.

### `prompts.ts`

**Changes:**
- A very minor change to the last line, from ``` to ``;. This appears to be a correction to properly close a multi-line string or a formatting fix.

**Review:**

1.  **Correctness:**
    *   **Good:** This looks like a necessary correction to properly terminate the string literal, ensuring the prompt content is correctly defined. It doesn't appear to introduce any logical errors.

2.  **Nit: Newline at End of File:**
    *   **Suggestion:** Similar to `index.ts`, this file also appears to be missing a newline character at the end. It's a good practice to ensure all text files end with a newline.

**Overall Summary:**

These changes are positive, particularly the enhancements in `index.ts` which significantly improve the usability and robustness of the `codeReviewAgent` by making the prompt dynamic and adding error handling. The change in `prompts.ts` seems like a minor but necessary correction. The only recurring minor suggestion is to ensure a newline character exists at the end of both files for consistency and best practice.
