# Code Review Summary

## Overview of Changes

This review covers modifications made to `index.ts` and `prompts.ts` within the `../my-agent` directory. The primary goal of these changes is to enhance the agent's instructions for code review, commit message generation, and review output.

## File-by-File Review

### `index.ts`

*   **Observation:** The prompt string passed to `codeReviewAgent` has been updated to include instructions for generating a commit message and writing the review to markdown.
*   **Feedback:** This is a clear and direct update to reflect the expanded requirements for the agent's operation. It accurately reflects the new steps the agent needs to perform.
*   **Suggestion:** None. This change is straightforward and serves its purpose well.

### `prompts.ts`

*   **Observation:** The formatting for tool names (`generateCommitMessageTool`, `writeReviewToMarkdownTool`) within the prompt was changed from backticks (`) to single quotes (`'`).
*   **Feedback:** Using backticks (`) is the conventional Markdown syntax for code snippets or technical terms, which helps distinguish them from regular text and improves readability. Switching to single quotes might make them less prominent.
*   **Suggestion:** Consider reverting this change to use backticks (` `` `) around the tool names (e.g., `` `generateCommitMessageTool` ``). This aligns better with Markdown best practices and improves the clarity of the prompt.
